# üìù Detailed Analysis Report

## 1. Overview

This report analyzes SSH brute-force and port scanning attempts using Wireshark in a controlled lab environment.

---

## 2. SSH Brute-Force Analysis

- **Attack Tool**: Hydra with `rockyou.txt` wordlist.
- **Observed Behavior**:
  - The attacker‚Äôs IP repeatedly sends TCP SYN packets to the target on port 22.
  - Wireshark shows repeated SSH authentication attempts with failed logins.
  - Brute-force attempts are evident from consistent packet patterns and multiple failed login attempts.

- **Indicators**:
  - Repeated TCP SYN ‚Üí SYN-ACK ‚Üí RST.
  - Destination port consistently 22/tcp.
  - SSH protocol streams reveal key exchange attempts.

---

## 3. Port Scan Analysis

- **Attack Tool**: Nmap
- **Observed Behavior**:
  - The attacker‚Äôs IP sends a high volume of SYN packets to a range of destination ports.
  - Wireshark shows:
    - SYN-only packets for closed ports.
    - SYN-ACK responses from open ports.

- **Indicators**:
  - Sequential port numbers in the destination field.
  - SYN flags without corresponding ACK packets.

## 4. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| Indicator             | Description           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Source IP: 192.168.x.x  | Attacker‚Äôs IP        |
| Destination IP: 192.168.x.x | Target‚Äôs IP      |
| Port: 22/tcp          | SSH brute-force       |
| Ports: 0-1000         | Nmap port scan range  |

## 6. Recommendations

- Deploy **fail2ban** or SSH rate limiting to prevent brute-force attempts.
- Monitor system logs for repeated failed SSH login attempts.
- Use strong, unique passwords and disable root login over SSH.
- Implement an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect port scans and brute-force attempts.
- Keep systems updated with the latest security patches.

## 7. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to detect malicious traffic using Wireshark. Screenshots and filters highlight attacker behaviors and show how network-based attacks can be analyzed effectively.
